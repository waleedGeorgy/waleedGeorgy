## Hi there and welcome to my Github! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Waleed Georgy. I'm a programmer and researcher who is interested in many things, but mainly machine learning, deep learning and finding new solutions for NP-complete and NP-hard problems. I always stife to perfect myself and learn new things. I have a strong background in teaching, researching, building different kinds of projects and working in a team. I'm also multilingual (English, Russian, Arabic) which helps me look at things and analize them from different angles.
