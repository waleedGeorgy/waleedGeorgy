# Hi there and welcome to my GitHub! 👋
My name is Waleed Georgy. I'm a programmer and researcher who is interested in many things, but mainly machine learning, deep learning and finding new solutions for NP-complete and NP-hard problems. I've also recently got into full-stack development and already managed to build various different projects.<br />
I always strife to perfect myself and learn new things. I have a strong background in teaching, researching, building different kinds of projects and working in a team.<br />
I'm also multilingual, which helps me look at things and analyze them from different angles.
